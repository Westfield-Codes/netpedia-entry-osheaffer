	<h2>What is uBlock Origin?</h2>
	<p>
		<strong>uBlock Origin</strong> is an open source content filtering extension that can be used with many different browsers (though in particular, I would reccomend using it in tandem with Firefox, aka the best broswer) and it's highly customisable.
		The primary function most people install it for is to block advertisements to streamline your online experience, but it can also block trackers that may be intruding on your internet privacy.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ublock initially released to the public in 2014, and today still ranks as one of the best and most reliable ad blockers available.

	<h2>Why use an Ad blocker?</h2>
	<p>
		As the name implies, an ad blocker blocks ads, but what can you get out of this.
		The main reason one would likely wish ads to be gone is to have a cleaner screenâ€”devoid of the clutter that can be brought from unwanted ads and irritating pop-ups.
		Though perhaps one may want to allow ads on specific sites, maybe they want to be able to support a certain content creator or two through ad revenue. 
		If this is you and you harbour concerns over using an ad blocker, don't fret. uBlock Origin has many options and tools available to users. If one wishes to allow ads on a particular site, then they may whitelist it, and uBlock will then check that list and allow ads on anything within it, while still blocking them on every other site.
		Less advanced users may have some trouble with customising, but with only a little learning, they too will have access to a more refined web experience fitting their needs.
